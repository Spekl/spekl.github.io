What are Spekl Recipes?
======================

Spekl makes it easy to drop in new verification checks into your projects. To that end we've created an easy to use reference of available checks in Spekl we call "Recipes." Browse the sections below to find out the kinds of checks you can add to your programs. 


OpenJML

OpenJML is a suite of tools for editing, parsing, type-checking, verifying (static checking), and run-time checking Java programs that are annotated with JML statements stating what the program's methods are supposed to do and the invariants the data structures should obey. JML annotations state preconditions, postconditions, invariants and the like about a method or class; OpenJML's tools will then check that the implementation and the specifications are consistent.

The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a behavioral interface specification language (BISL) that can be used to specify the behavior of Java modules. It combines the design by contract approach of Eiffel and the model-based specification approach of the Larch family of interface specification languages, with some elements of the refinement calculus.

Runtime Assertion Checking
--------------------------


Extended Static Checking
------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml
		
  checks :
    - name        : openjml-esc
      description : "OpenJML Extended Static Checking"
      paths       : [A.java]  # your source files
      classpath   : []        # classpath needed to compile your project
  
      tool:
        name      : openjml-esc


FindBugs
========

FindBugs uses static analysis to inspect Java bytecode for occurrences of bug patterns.  Static analysis means that FindBugs can find bugs by simply inspecting a program's code: executing the program is not necessary.  This makes FindBugs very easy to use: in general, you should be able to use it to look for bugs in your code within a few minutes of downloading it.  FindBugs works by analyzing Java bytecode (compiled class files), so you don't even need the program's source code to use it.  Because its analysis is sometimes imprecise, FindBugs can report false warnings, which are warnings that do not indicate real errors.  In practice, the rate of false warnings reported by FindBugs is less than 50%.

Run FindBugs and Generate HTML Reports
--------------------------------------


.. code-block:: yaml
		
  checks :
    - name        : findbugs-html
      description : "FindBugs HTML Report"
      check       : html
      paths       : [A.class]  # your class files
  
      tool:
        name      : findbugs



Run FindBugs and Generate XML Reports
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml
		
  checks :
    - name        : findbugs-xml
      description : "FindBugs XML Report"
      check       : xml
      paths       : [A.class]  # your classfiles
  
      tool:
        name      : findbugs

SAW
===

The Software Analysis Workbench (SAW) provides the ability to formally verify properties of code written in C, Java, and Cryptol. It leverages automated SAT and SMT solvers to make this process as automated as possible, and provides a scripting language, called SAW Script, to enable verification to scale up to more complex systems.

Verify that Two Implementations are Equivalent
----------------------------------------------


.. code-block:: yaml
		
  checks :
    - name        : saw
      description : "SAW"
      check       : equiv-c
      paths       : [] #
      reference:
        file     : ffs_ref.c   # the reference file
        function : ffs_ref     # the reference function
      test:
        file     : ffs_test.c  # the file to check
        function : ffs_test    # the function to check
  
      tool:
        name      : saw


Checker Framework
=================

.. image:: http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/CFLogo.png
	   :align: right


Are you tired of null pointer exceptions, unintended side effects, SQL injections, concurrency errors, mistaken equality tests, and other run-time errors that appear during testing or in the field?

The Checker Framework enhances Javaâ€™s type system to make it more powerful and useful. This lets software developers detect and prevent errors in their Java programs. The Checker Framework includes compiler plug-ins ("checkers") that find bugs or verify their absence. It also permits you to write your own compiler plug-ins.
